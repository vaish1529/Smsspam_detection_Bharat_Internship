# Smsspam_detection_Bharat_Internship
This SMS classification project aims to automate the detection of spam messages from legitimate ones using machine learning techniques. By leveraging Python's data science libraries, particularly Scikit-learn, the project involves the entire machine learning pipeline â€“ from data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment.

The project likely explores various classifiers available in Scikit-learn to identify the most suitable algorithm for the SMS classification task. The focus on utilizing text-based features for classification suggests the use of techniques that convert text data into numerical representations.

Key steps include data cleaning to remove noise, tokenization to break down text into words or phrases, and the use of machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from these text features. Evaluating and comparing model performance ensures the selection of an effective classifier for deployment.

The ultimate goal of the project is to create a robust and accurate classifier that can classify incoming SMS messages in real-time, helping users distinguish between spam and non-spam content efficiently.

Overall, this project demonstrates a comprehensive application of machine learning in the realm of text classification, specifically for SMS data, providing a valuable tool for spam detection and user convenience.
